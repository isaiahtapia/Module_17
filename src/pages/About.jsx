            <p>My name is Isaiah Tapia, and I'm a 23 year old up-incoming full stack developer. Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. I have completed a bachelor's degree in Psychology and now I'm pursing my second bachelor's in Computer Science. Growing up, I was always interested in the tech industry especially with how rapidly it was growing. It may be challenging but I'm very excited to enter the field!</p>
